# The Simple Dividend Analyzer
#### Background
Even experienced investors can have a bias toward the appeal of dividend bearing stocks. They "promise a fixed return", after all.
Or do they? 
The Simple Dividend Analyzer is an easy way to avoid over-estimating the attractivenes of dividends: it provides a quick snapshot of the full(er) picture, including the non-dividend gains of the stock and the market returns as a whole. That should balance the perception of the dividend's "promise". In many cases, it will be shaddowed by the overall losses of the stock; in other cases it will be shaddowed by the overall returns of the market as a whole. And even when the stock has great overall gains (such as Apple's 50%+ gains in 2017). In fact, when a company announces a dividend, it's essentially saying "we couldn't figure out a better way to spend this money on more growth, so we'll just give it to you", which should be factored into the analysis. 
#### Summary of Functionality
The app allows the user to input any stock symbol. If that stock is dividend bearing, the app will compute its annualized dividend rate and compare it to the non-dividend performance of that stock over the past year, as well as the market baseline performance over the past year (S&P 500).
